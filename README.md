This code is current available as an app on Google Play, at the following URL: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orangebytes.slide

The app was originally written for www.orangebytes.net, my personal app and web project.

The code was written entirely by myself, unless otherwise noted (sliding menu library, animation library). I also created the UI elements, layouts and general design. The images and background music were provided by my room mate.
